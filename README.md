# Titanic-DataSet
Explore the relationship between variables and survival rate.  Use Machine Learning techniques to train and validate a model.

INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RUN THE PYTHON NOTEBOOK - Requires a IDE like Spyder
1. In order to run this python notebook the two data sets "train.csv" and "test.csv" need to be downloaded into the same location.
2. Download the "Titanic analysis.py" into the same location as the csv files.
3. Open the "Titanic analysis.py" using a IDE like Spyder.
4. I suggest running the code as sections, sections all have """SOME TEXT""" at the beginning and the section ends when the next """SOME TEXT""" appears.  While notebook will run as a whole, I find it easier to see the results if it is run section by section.  
5. I have also included comments on my thoughts and analysis in each section, so running it by section makes it easier to see the code, results and my comments.
6. If you do not have a way to run the python notebook I am also including the output and comments in the "Titanic Analysis comment and graph write up.docx"
7. NOTE: Reading the Comments from the Python code, makes more sense compared to just reading the "Titanic Analysis comment and graph write up.docx" as I designed the comments to go along with the code.  If I were to present this in a professional setting I would create a powerpoint with the graphs and some of the other data points like mean and medians.  I would just have talking points and visual aids.  The "Titanic Analysis comment and graph write up.docx" is meant as an aid if you are unable to open and run the Python code.
